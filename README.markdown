# About this collection of files

Here you will find my configuration files for the http://www.uzbl.org/
web browser.  They are based on the example configuration that ships
with the uzbl repository: http://github.com/Dieterbe/uzbl

I have full intent to feed my changes back to upstream when they have
been tested.  Feel free to let me know if you have any issues.

# How to use them

These files live in ~/.uzbl on my system.  After cloning I create a
symlink from `~/.config/uzbl/config` to `configs/uzbl.config`.  This can
be done with *make install*.
